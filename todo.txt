- A concentrated solution with a high molality (let's say 10 mol/kg) is available. How much solvent (in kg) needs to be added to 2 moles of the solution to create a new solution with a final molality of 3 mol/kg?
- find path of least resistance when solving
- proper limits for all variables (no.of molecules shouldnt be 3 or 7, Xa+Xb must be 1, etc.)
- add debugger
